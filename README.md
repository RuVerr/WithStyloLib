All mixins start with the `with*` prefix and allow you to easily style:

- Flex and Grid containers
- Sizes, widths, and heights

- Backgrounds, borders, and shadows
- Animations and transforms
- Responsive design (media queries)

Using these mixins helps keep your code clean and speeds up the styling process.
